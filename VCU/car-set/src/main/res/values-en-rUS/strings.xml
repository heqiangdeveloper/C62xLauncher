3. Do not put or leave objects between the charging board and the charging equipment; Pay special attention to coins, keys, rings, ornaments, bus cards, silver cards and other similar items; \n
4. If the equipment  or metal foreign matters incompatible with the wireless charging standard of Qi are placed in the charging area, the charging may be interrupted, the object may become hot, and the charging board may be damaged when the object enters.

    <string name="iacc_details">&#160;The intelligent cruise assist system (IACC) provides the driver with longitudinal and
        transverse assistance of the vehicle in the full speed range (0~150km/h).The longitudinal assistance is realized by the
        adaptive cruise control system ACC, which controls the vehicle to cruise with the front vehicle in the range of 0~150km/h,
        or to cruise at a constant speed in the range of 30~150km/h. The time distance between vehicle and the front vehicle
        can also be set. IACC will preferentially enter the horizontal auxiliary control by identifying the clear lane lines on both
        sides of the lane. At this time, IACC is in the lane line control mode, and the instrument IACC icon is displayed as green,
        while the lane line is displayed as blue. When the speed is lower than 60km/h, if the lane line is not identified, you can also
        follow the identified front vehicle. At this time, the IACC is in the following vehicle control mode, the
        instrument IACC icon displays green, and the front vehicle displays blue.The intelligent cruise assist system is
        a driving assistance function, which does not allow the driver to drive off-hand. The system covers all driving scenes,
        traffic, weather and road conditions. Even if the system is activated, the driver must drive carefully and abide by
        traffic rules </string>
    <string name="fcw_details">&#160;Forward collision warning FCW detects vehicle and pedestrian targets through radar and camera.
        When a potential collision risk between the self vehicle and the vehicle, pedestrian or other
        objects in front is detected, an audible and visual alarm will be issued to remind the driver. The forward
        collision warning system includes safety distance alarm, pre alarm and emergency alarm functions.
        In the process of driving, if the self vehicle follows closely for a long time, the system will send out
        a safety distance alarm and the instrument will prompt the driver that the self vehicle is too close to the
        vehicle in front. In the process of driving, when there is a risk of collision between the self
        vehicle and the vehicle in front of it, the system will give an early warning in visual and auditory ways,
        the combination instrument will prompt the information, and sound the alarm at the same time. The driver shall
        take appropriate actions in time to ensure a safe driving distance. After the pre alarm, if the driver still does not
        respond, the emergency alarm will be triggered, and the system will apply a short brake. In some emergencies, the pre
        alarm may be skipped and the emergency alarm may be triggered directly. The driver should not rely too much on the
        system, and should not deliberately test or wait for the trigger of the system. Due to the inherent limitations
        of the system, false triggering cannot be completely avoided.</string>
    <string name="aeb_details">&#160;The emergency brake AEB is used to enter the active brake in case of emergency,
        to help the driver avoid collision or reduce the injury caused by collision.
        When the system detects that there is a danger of collision with the vehicle or pedestrian in front and it is very urgent,
        if the driver has taken braking actions, but the braking force is insufficient,
        the AEB system will provide the remaining braking force to achieve the best target braking
        force to avoid or reduce the injury caused by the collision; If the driver does not take braking actions,
        the system will automatically apply the brake within its ability to avoid or reduce the injury caused by collision.
        It should be noted that the AEB system is a kind of auxiliary function for the driver. Don\'t risk driving.
        The driver must keep the control of the vehicle and take full responsibility for the vehicle. Moreover,
        due to the inherent limitations of the system, under some complex conditions, the system may misidentify vehicles and pedestrians,
        causing unnecessary braking.</string>
    <string name="lane_assist_details">&#160; When the self driving speed is above 60 km/h, the lane assist
        system detects the lane line through the camera to provide the driver with lateral assistance of vehicles,
        including Lane Departure Warning System (LDW), Lane Keep Assist System (LKS), and Road Departure
        Assist System (RDP). The driver can choose different systems according to his driving habits. Lane
        Departure Warning System (LDW) When it detects that a vehicle is deviating from the lane and the
        driver has no intention to change lanes, the system will give a visual and audible alarm to warn the
        driver that the vehicle is deviating from the lane. It should be noted that the system only provides
        alarm function and does not provide steering assistance. Lane Keeping Assist System (LKS) assists the
        driver to keep the vehicle driving in the middle of the lane by applying steering anticipation. Road
        Departure Assist System (RDP) When it detects that the vehicle is about to depart from the lane
        and the driver has no intention to change lanes, the system will assist the driver to keep the
        vehicle in the lane by applying steering intervention. If the vehicles continue to deviate from
        the lane line, the lane departure warning will be triggered at the same time. It should be noted
        that this system only serves as an auxiliary function and cannot replace the driver\'s control.
        When the camera is covered, or the vehicle is in the backlight, glare, night and other environments,
        the system may exit for a short time, or there may be false alarm or missing alarm. Road construction,
